The Signup Form project is a web development project included in The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Course. It is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides a signup form for users to register on a website. The project provides an opportunity for developers to practice their front-end development skills and gain experience in building user interfaces.

The goal of the project is to build a fully functional signup form web application that allows users to register on a website. This project will help developers to understand how to create dynamic web pages, interact with forms, and handle user input.
